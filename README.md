# diagnostic-nvim (DEPRECATED)

After the creation of `vim.lsp.diagnostic` (See: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12655) 
`nvim-lua/diagnostic.nvim` is deprecated. To find out how to migrate, checkout the [migration guide](https://github.com/nvim-lua/diagnostic-nvim/issues/73).

You should uninstall diagnostic-nvim if you are on latest master.
